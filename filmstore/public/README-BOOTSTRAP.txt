To change the theme of the page (application) you have to go here
      /node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
Then you have to go here
        http://bootswatch.com/darkly/bootstrap.min.css
And copy the darkly theme on this url and paste it in the local bootstrap.min.css file.

I hope it was useful for you. :D
